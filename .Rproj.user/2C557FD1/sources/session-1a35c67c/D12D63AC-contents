However, when I'm in a statistical spree just like now, my basic programming level is quite alright.

Nevertheless, what I would like to be able to do is to get entirely rid of MS Word and use only R/RStudio/Quarto Markdown to write an article manuscript and to integrate Zotero.

I try to use both frequentist and bayesian stats. I mainly carry out descriptive and inferential stats with emphasis on Cluster Analysis, Latent Class Analysis, Factor Analysis/Principal Component Analysis, Structural Equation Modelling.
